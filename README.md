🧠 Overview

This experiment demonstrates how adaptive automation enables an AI model to recalibrate itself intelligently in response to changes in the data environment. It simulates a real-world scenario where the model detects performance drift and autonomously improves without requiring a full retraining cycle.

✏️ Objective

To build and evaluate an adaptive learning model that can automatically adjust its learning parameters when environmental conditions or data patterns change.

📗 Results

The adaptive recalibration process significantly improved model performance after detecting environmental drift. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) decreased noticeably after applying intelligent auto-adjustment, proving the effectiveness of continuous learning and adaptive automation for long-term AI reliability.

📓 Notes

This experiment highlights how AI systems can evolve independently, maintaining accuracy and operational stability through intelligent self-recalibration. It provides a foundation for future research on dynamic, self-maintaining models that can function effectively in complex, ever-changing environments.
